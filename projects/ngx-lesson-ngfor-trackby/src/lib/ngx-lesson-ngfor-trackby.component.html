<h1>Improve *ngFor  usability and performance with trackBy</h1>
<h3>Prevent <span style= "color:red">loss of focus</span> and <span style= "color:red">reconstrution</span> of elements in your <span style= "color:red">*ngFor on collection change</span> with trackBy</h3>

<p>
  Note: “change the collection-data” means to replace the collection with new objects and not keeping the same reference.

<h2 style="color: red">Without trackBy :(</h2>
<h4>Try inputting text in the input boxes</h4>
<h3>Notice, as the ngFor items change, the text you have input, goes away and the focus is lost</h3>
<h3>ngFor here is not tracking elements by id or index. <span style="color: red">When items-collection changes ngFor just destroys and recreates elements for each</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items">
    <input>
    <span [ngClass]=item.color >{{item.id}} | {{item.name}}</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: darkgreen">With track by :)</h2>
<h4>Try inputting text in the input boxes</h4>
<h3>Notice, as the ngFor items change as, text and focus in input boxes is reatained</h3>
<h3>ngFor is tracking each element to its rendering in dom by id, and <span style="color: darkgreen">it jsut renders the correponding changes in place using using standard change detaction </span> instead of destroying and recreating elements</h3>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let itemTrackBy of itemsTrackBy; trackBy:trackByFn">
    <input>
    <span [ngClass]=itemTrackBy.color >{{itemTrackBy.id}} | {{itemTrackBy.name}}</span>
  </li>
</ul>

  Note: If you don't have id (unique-key) for each data-item in your collection, you can always tracBy index (second argument pased to tracByFn)
  If you use a field to track by that is not unique, angualr will trhow an error
