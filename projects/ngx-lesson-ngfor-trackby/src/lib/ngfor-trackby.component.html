<h1>Improve *ngFor  usability and performance with trackBy | Lesson by <a href="https://github.com/simars" target="_blank">Simar</a></h1>
<h3>Prevent <span style= "color:red">loss of focus</span> and <span style= "color:red">reconstrution</span> of elements in your <span style= "color:red">*ngFor on collection change</span> with trackBy</h3>

<p>
  Note: “change the collection-data” means to replace the collection with new objects and not keeping the same reference.

<h1>Example</h1>
<h2>Tracking ngFor on list items changing every 5 seconds switching line bullets between english & spanish in different colors</h2>

<h2 style="color: red">Without trackBy :(</h2>
<h4>Try inputting text in the input boxes</h4>
<h3>Notice, as the ngFor items change the focus and cursor from the input box you were typing goes away, and you will find you aren't typing anywhere</h3>
<h3>ngFor here is not tracking elements by id or index.
  <span style="color: red">When items-collection changes ngFor just destroys and recreates elements for each</span>
</h3>

<h2 style="color: darkgreen">With track by :)</h2>
<h4>Try inputting text in the input boxes</h4>
<h3>Notice, as the ngFor items change as, text and focus and cursor in input boxes stays, and you can continue typing even as the bullets keep changing </h3>
<h3>ngFor is tracking each element to its rendering in dom by id, and
  <span style="color: darkgreen">it just renders the corresponding changes in place using using standard change detection </span>
  <del> instead of destroying and recreating elements</del>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let itemTrackBy of items; trackBy: trackByFn; let i = index">
    <strong [style.color]="itemTrackBy.color" >{{itemTrackBy.id}} | {{itemTrackBy.name}}</strong>

<h2>
  Note: If you don't have id (unique-key) for each data-item in your collection, you can always trackBy index (second argument passed to trackByFn).
  If you use a field to track by that is not unique, angular will throw an error
